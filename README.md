# Patient-health-monitoring-using-ESap32-and-web-server

Survey analysis:
➤ We have conducted a survey in several villages

➤ The report of the survey says that people need to check their health condi frequently

➤ In villages there is no proper hospitals and health care centers
➤ They said, they need to spend their hole day to go to hospitals which far away from their place and also they are not having a bad health condition instead they need to check their health condition regularly
➤ The most of the peoples are daily wages workers they did not spend their hole day it will reflect on their income

Problem Statement : This patient health monitoring system will useful for a people who wants to check their basic health condition
➤ We have conducted the survey most of the people needs to check their health regularly but the problem is they all are a daily wages employees and they are away from hospital
➤ If they went to hospital for a basic check up, they need to spend their whole day and it will affect their income
➤ This project will be useful in some emergency situations
➤ Example: covid 19 lockdown

Problem description:this project, we have designed the IoT Based Patient Health Monitoring System using ESP8266 & Arduino. The IoT platform used in this project is Thing Speak Thing Speak is an open-source Internet of Things (IoT) application and API to store and retrieve data from things using the HTTP protocol over the Internet or via a Local Area Network. This IoT device could read the pulse rate and measure the surrounding temperature. It continuously monitors the pulse rate and surrounding temperature and updates them to an loT platform.
